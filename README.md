PROBLEM STATEMENT:
      No adequate facility  for  providing better experience and ease of access to visually impired people.
      User Experience is critical for the success and failure of a product.
      Accessibility is one  of the important factor in user experience  where we should consider  providing  experience  to differently abled users  also.
